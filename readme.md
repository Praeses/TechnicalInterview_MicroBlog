Technical Interview: Micro Blog
=============================
**Purpose**

The purpose of this exercise is to measure the candidateâ€™s ability to satisfy business rules, while also demonstrating their ability to further enhance the solution. The solution should not only satisfy the business requirements outlined below, but should also give the candidate an opportunity to show-off their skills.

We should be able to pull down the source, hit F5 in Visual Studio and the solution should run with all databases created and populated. We will reject submissions that do not follow this rule. Once you think you have finished, it is suggested that you wipe all remnants of your application from your computer (delete databases, etc), clone the repository into a different directory and try to run it to ensure it works properly.  Assume we have Visual Studio 2013 and SQL Local DB on our boxes. If your app needs something outside of those requirements, make sure you bootstrap that in your application code so we don't have to manually install any dependencies when looking at your solution. Nuget packages you wish to add are perfectly acceptable.

**Pre-Interview Requirements**

1. User should be able to register for an account.
2. User should be able to create a blog post.
3. User should be able to see a feed of their own blog posts.
4. User should be able to follow other users.
5. User should be able to see a feed of blog posts from users they follow.
6. Implement any additional features as requested by your point of contact.
    + For example, if you are interviewing for a mobile developer position you may be asked to implement your solution using a "mobile-first" approach.
7. Add any features / functionality that you would want in a "micro blog" client.
8. All business logic and data access should happen via calls to an API.
    + **A pull request must be made prior to the due date.**

**Tip**

It is NOT expected that this will be an enterprise ready web application. With that being said it is expected that this application will be intuitive to use. This should be something that you would use, or would encourage your friends to use.

**You Will Need**

1. Visual Studio Community Edition
2. A GitHub account
3. Implement the features above in a repository forked from https://github.com/Praeses/TechnicalInterview_MicroBlog
